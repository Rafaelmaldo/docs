Manage your API keys from [**Settings → API**](https://wiza.co/app/settings/api).

- Each account can generate up to **three (3) API keys** in total.
- Keys can be disabled as needed, but once three keys are created, no additional keys can be generated. This includes keys that were previously disabled.
