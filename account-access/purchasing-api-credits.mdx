API credits can be purchased in one of two ways:

- **Enterprise API plans** – In **Settings** **→ API**, click **Contact Sales** to inquire about larger credit plans that include volume discounts. Alternatively, you can book directly using [this link](https://schedule.wiza.co/meet/kj-chow/call).
- **Direct purchase via UI** – Use the slider in the User Interface to buy smaller amounts of credits. Ensure a valid credit card is on file in the **Billing** tab to process the payment and apply the credits.

<Note>
  API credits have a validity of **12 months**.
