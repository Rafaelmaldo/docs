Wiza can send webhook notifications to your server when enrichment requests complete. This allows you to process results asynchronously without polling the API.

## Setup

Configure your webhook URL in [Settings → API](https://wiza.co/app/settings/api). Wiza will send a POST request to this URL when a list enrichment completes.

## Callback URL

You can also specify a `callback_url` in your API request to override the default webhook URL:

```json
{
  "list": {
    "name": "My List",
    "enrichment_level": "partial",
    "email_options": {
      "accept_work": true,
      "accept_personal": true
    },
    "items": [...],
    "callback_url": "https://your-server.com/webhooks/wiza"
  }
}
```

## Webhook Payload

When a list completes, Wiza sends a POST request with the same payload as the list response:

```json
{
  "status": {
    "code": 200,
    "message": ""
  },
  "data": {
    "list": {
      "id": 123456,
      "name": "My List",
      "status": "completed",
      "total_contacts": 10,
      "completed_contacts": 10,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication

Webhook requests include an `x-auth-key` header containing a SHA256 hash of your API key. Use this to verify the request originated from Wiza:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(request, apiKey) {
  const receivedHash = request.headers['x-auth-key'];
  const expectedHash = crypto
    .createHash('sha256')
    .update(apiKey)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return receivedHash === expectedHash;
}
```

## Status Handling

Check the `status` field in the webhook payload:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `completed` | List enrichment finished successfully |
| `failed` | List enrichment failed (check `fail_error` for details) |

<Note>
Lists may fail due to LinkedIn rate limiting. Always check the status field and handle failures appropriately.
</Note>

## Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint returns a non-2xx response, Wiza will not automatically retry. Ensure your endpoint is available and returns a 200 status code to acknowledge receipt.
