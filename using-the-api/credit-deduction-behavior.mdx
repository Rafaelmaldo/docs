Credits are pre-paid in bulk and deducted only when data is successfully returned:

| Data Type | Enrichment Level | Credits Deducted |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Phones | `"enrichment_level": "phone"` or `"full"` | 5 credits if at least one phone number is returned |
| Emails | `"enrichment_level": "email"` or `"full"` | 2 credits if at least one "valid" marked email is returned |
| LinkedIn profile details | `"enrichment_level": "none"` | 1 credit if a LinkedIn URL is found and matched |

## Confirming Credit Deductions

After making a POST request and retrieving results via the GET endpoint (`https://wiza.co/api/individual_reveals/{id}`), you can confirm the credits that were deducted in the response under the `credits` object.

The relevant fields include:

- **api_credits.total** – Total API credits remaining
- **api_credits.email_credits** – Number of credits deducted due to emails found
- **api_credits.phone_credits** – Number of credits deducted due to phones found
- **api_credits.scrape_credits** – Number of credits deducted due to LinkedIn URLs found

**Sample GET Response Snippet:**

```json
"credits": {
    "api_credits": {
        "total": 5,
        "email_credits": 0,
        "phone_credits": 5,
        "scrape_credits": 0
    }
}
```
