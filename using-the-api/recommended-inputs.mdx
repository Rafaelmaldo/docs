For the `/api/individual_reveals` endpoint, provide one of the following input options per request. Different inputs offer varying levels of coverage and accuracy and are listed below from highest to lowest.

1. **LinkedIn URL** (strongly recommended) - provides the highest performing results
2. **Full name + company domain and/or company name** - including a company domain improves match accuracy, as domains are unique while company names may have duplicates. This option provides the next best performing results.
3. **Email address** - Use only if other input options are unavailable
