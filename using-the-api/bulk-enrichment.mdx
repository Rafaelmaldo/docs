Use the Start Individual Reveal endpoint (`https://wiza.co/api/individual_reveals`) to submit requests in batches. Requests will process in parallel in accordance with your [concurrency limit](/overview/usage-limits#concurrency-limit). Requests beyond the limit queue automatically and are processed as slots free up, enabling efficient bulk enrichment.
