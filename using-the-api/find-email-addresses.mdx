Wiza may return one work email and one personal email per profile.

## Step 1: Start Individual Reveal

**Endpoint:** `https://wiza.co/api/individual_reveals`

Send a POST request with your API key, setting `"enrichment_level": "partial"` to retrieve emails. Use the `email_options` object to specify whether you want to find work emails, personal emails, or both. The response will include an `id`, which you will use in Step 2. 

- `"accept_work": true` → include work emails
- `"accept_personal": true` → include personal emails
- Setting a value to `false` indicates that you do not want to retrieve that type of email.

<Note>
  Requests for work emails may take 0 - 380 seconds to process, with an average response time of ~25 seconds. Requests for personal emails may take 0 - 15 seconds to process, with an average response time of ~4 seconds. 
</Note>

**Sample Request Body:**

```json
{
  "individual_reveal": {
    "profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-hakami-5babb21b0/"
  },
  "enrichment_level": "partial",
  "email_options": {
    "accept_work": true,
    "accept_personal": false
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Reveal Results

**Endpoint:** `GET https://wiza.co/api/individual_reveals/{id}`

Use the `id` returned from Step 1 to access the enriched data. For best results, parse `email`, `email_type`, and `email_status` from the emails array. Multiple emails may be returned per profile.
