Wiza may return up to three mobile numbers per profile. For highest quality results, parse the following fields:

- **phone_number** – Primary mobile number, highest quality in E.164 format.
- **number_pretty** – Human-readable format (e.g., +1 (123) 456-7890).
- **number** – Raw number from the phones array, in E.164 format.

<Note>
- In the phones array, `"type": "mobile"` and `"type": "other"` are all mobile numbers
- All numbers in the phones array (up to three) can be parsed
- Do not rely solely on `mobile_phone`
</Note>

## Step 1: Start Individual Reveal

**Endpoint:** `https://wiza.co/api/individual_reveals`

Send a POST request with your API key and `"enrichment_level": "phone"`. The request may take 0-15 seconds to process, with an average response time of ~4 seconds. The response will include an `id`, which you will use in Step 2.

**Sample Request Body:**

```json
{
  "individual_reveal": {
    "profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-hakami-5babb21b0/"
  },
  "enrichment_level": "phone"
}
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Reveal Results

Use the `id` returned from Step 1 to access the enriched data. For best results, parse `phone_number`, `number_pretty`, or `number`. Wiza may return up to three mobile numbers in E.164 format.
