Wiza can be used in n8n by using the official Wiza node and inputting your Wiza API key. Wiza's node enables n8n users to find email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and LinkedIn profile data. These enrichments consume Wiza API credits, which can be purchased and monitored in your Wiza account settings > API.

## How to use Wiza in n8n

1. Sign in to n8n, open the editor, and click **+** in the top right to open the Nodes panel
2. Search for **Wiza** using the search bar. Look for the version marked by a badge image. Then, select **install**.
3. Once Wiza is installed, just drag, drop, and connect it like any other node in a workflow.

See the [Wiza n8n Integration page](https://n8n.io/integrations/wiza/) for more details, Wiza + n8n workflow templates, and to get started.
