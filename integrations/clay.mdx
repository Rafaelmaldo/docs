description: "Use Wiza within Clay for enrichment workflows"

Wiza can be used in Clay by connecting your Wiza API key. Clay workflows can then run Wiza enrichments for emails, mobile phone numbers, LinkedIn profile data, and company information. These enrichments consume Wiza API credits, which can be purchased and monitored in your Wiza account.

Enrichments follow the same [usage limits](/overview/usage-limits) and [credit deduction rules](/using-the-api/credit-deduction-behavior) as direct API requests.

See the [Wiza Integration Overview](https://www.clay.com/integrations/wiza) page for more details.
