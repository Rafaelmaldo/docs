description: "Use Wiza within Clay for enrichment workflows"
---

Wiza can be used in Clay by connecting your Wiza API key. Clay workflows can then run Wiza enrichments for emails, mobile phone numbers, LinkedIn profile data, and company information. These enrichments consume Wiza API credits, which can be purchased and monitored in your Wiza account.

Enrichments follow the same usage limits and credit deduction rules as direct API requests.

## How to use Wiza in Clay

See the [Wiza Integration Overview page](https://www.clay.com/integrations/wiza) for more details.
