Wiza can be used in Apollo.io's waterfall enrichment feature by connecting your Wiza API key. Apollo.io's waterfall feature enables users to add and prioritize Wiza as a primary data source when enriching lists built with emails and phone numbers. These enrichments use Wiza API credits, which can be purchased and monitored in your Wiza account.
